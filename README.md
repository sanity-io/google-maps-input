## Know issues in Studio V3

- Diff-preview is not implemented.

These will be re-added well before Studio V3 GA.

## Installation

In your studio folder, run:

```
npm install --save @sanity/google-maps-input
```

or

```
yarn add @sanity/google-maps-input
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in sanity.config.ts (or .js), with a valid [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key):

```js
import {googleMapsInput} from '@sanity/google-maps-input'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    googleMapsInput({
      apiKey: 'my-api-key',
    }),
  ],
})
```

Ensure that the key has access to:

- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Google Places API Web Service
- Google Static Maps API

And that the key allows web-access from the Studio URL(s) you are using the plugin in.

Note: This plugin will replace the default `geopoint` input component.
